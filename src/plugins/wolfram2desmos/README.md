# wolfram2desmos
Convert WolframAlpha (ASCIImath) into Desmos LaTeX. Pretty much built from scratch and is not dependent on preexisting libraries or packages.

Open up `wolfram2desmos.js` and change input to whatever string you want. ie:

```javascript
input = "1/sqrt((23452 x) c (x c) + Ï€ + sqrt(135/1351235123))^5";
```

Execute the code and the terminal will spit out the LaTeX version of it.
I also recommend using https://www.intmath.com/help/asciimath-input-latex-katex-output.php who has done a way better job than me at doing this task. Cheers.
