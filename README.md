# wolfram2desmos
Convert WolframAlpha (ASCIImath) into Desmos LaTeX. Pretty much built from scratch and is not dependent on preexisting libraries or packages.

Open up wolfram2desmos/code.js and change <input> to the string you want. Execute the code and the terminal will spit out the LaTeX version of it.
